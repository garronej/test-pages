# Visual Studio Code

> *Visual Studio Code is a lightweight but powerful source code editor which runs on your desktop and is available for Windows, macOS and Linux. It comes with built-in support for JavaScript, TypeScript and Node.js.*

[VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) has become **one of the most popular code editors in the JavaScript ecosystem**. It offers useful features (auto-completion, debugging tools, etc.) that work very well with TypeScript and Node.js. That's why it has a dedicated page in the documentation.

But using VS Code is not mandatory to develop a FoalTS app. So feel free to use another code editor if you prefer.

## Configuring the linting

In order to directly print the ESLint errors in VS Code and auto-fix the problems on save you need to install the `ESLint` extension.

It can be installed by launching *VS Code Quick Open* (`Ctrl`+`P` or `Cmd`+`P`), pasting the following command, and pressing enter:

```
ext install dbaeumer.vscode-eslint
```

Then, you will need to configure it for TypeScript and make it fix the errors on save (when it is possible).

1. Open the *Command Palette* (`Ctrl`+`Shift`+`P` or `Cmd`+`Shift`+`P`) and type `Open Settings (JSON)`.

2. Then extend the settings to add the options below.

    ```json
    {
      // ...
      "eslint.validate": [
          "typescript"
      ],
      "editor.codeActionsOnSave": {
          "source.fixAll.eslint": true
      }
    }
    ```

## Debugging with VS Code

Run the following command to create the suitable debug config files.

```
foal generate vscode-config
```

Now you can add a breakpoint in your code and start the app in debug mode.

The generated files also include configurations to run your unit and end-to-end tests.
